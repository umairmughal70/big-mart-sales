Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data and build the predictive model.


Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values: We impute missing item weights by calculating the mean for each item identifier.
Feature engineering: We create new features like 'Item_category' and 'new_item' based on item identifiers.
Standardizing the 'Item_Fat_Content' values for consistency.

Model Development
We experiment with various machine learning models, including LightGBM, Extra Trees Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Additionally, we use a Voting Regressor to combine multiple models for improved predictions.

Results
The predictive models aim to estimate sales accurately. The performance of each model is evaluated based on relevant metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
